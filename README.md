# Item Selection Table

This project displays a list of items with information such as name, price, location, owner, and availability in stock. Users can select or deselect items by clicking on each row, and a summary of selected items is displayed at the top.

## Features
- **Item List:** Displays a list of items with columns for name, price, location, owner, and availability.
- **Selection Mechanism:** Click on an item row to toggle its selection.
- **Dynamic Selected Items Display:** Displays a list of selected items below the table.
- **Styled Table:** The table is styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and aesthetics.

## Technologies Used
- **Vue.js:** JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** JavaScript is used for item interaction and management.

## Installation

cd <project_directory>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run serve
```

## How it Works

1. **Data Binding:** The `items` array contains the items displayed in the table. It is bound to the template, and clicking on any row will call the `toggleItem()` method.
2. **Item Selection:** The `toggleItem()` method checks if the item is already selected. If it is, it calls `deleteItem()` to remove it from the selected items list. If not, it calls `addItem()` to add it.
3. **Dynamic Summary:** The number and names of selected items are dynamically updated and displayed at the top of the table.

## Code Overview

### Template
- Displays the total number of selected items.
- Renders a table with item details.
- Shows a list of selected item names below the table.

### Script
- Defines `items` as the data array.
- Implements methods for adding, deleting, and toggling selected items.
- Calculates the class for selected items and manages item selection state.

### Styles
- Tailwind CSS utility classes are used for layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- A scoped style for the table header background is included.

## Example
